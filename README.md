## How to use this repo

These instructions will help you to complete the challenges and assignments for our class.

The parts that you need to worry about changing are indicated by the comments of each file. Other areas of the file will have code that you shouldn't alter, and is used to test your changes. These areas have comments stating not to alter the test solutions.

Later in the course we will have empty files and a test suite setup. When you come to this point you will be required to read the tests created for you in order to generate the code. Or you will create tests for previously generated code.

Again for your first challenges DO NOT ALTER any code outside of the areas where the comments indicate you should update.

Further, sometimes files will have errors in them until you've completed your portion of the assignment and will not run on the initial attempt.
